# Snake
First attempt at a snake game.

Started this project blind and worked my way to successfully drawing ONE functional rectangle.

I learned how to manipulate the rectangle, moving it, drawing it in different styles, and wrapping it around the screen if it hit an edge.

Although I consider this attempt as a failure, I have learned much from it and will apply this knownledge to future projects, possibly a second attempt at a snake game.

This project will probably be repurposed for a third.
